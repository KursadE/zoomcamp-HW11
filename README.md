# zoomcamp-HW11

This repo consists of 2 yaml files and a text file. 

The text file includes commands written in the terminal window to execute requests made in the Homework page for Kubernetes lectures.

Testing is done and the result was verified within the working directory which was cloned as described in the Homework page. 

All the coding of the yaml files was done by using VSCODE.
